# Dynamics

Presentation material for the [Concept of .NET dynamics](). This talk was inspired by various "wild" usages of the dynamic keyword in multiple frameworks and tries to show that a smart dynamic usage can outweight the "dangers" of using dynamics in the first place.

This material is/was used in various forms at different talks/conferences:

* Internal presentation Mathema in Erlangen, July 19th 2013
* [Herbstcampus 2013](), Nürnberg, September 5th 2013

This talk was also written as an article (in German):

* [KaffeeKlatsch](), "Dynamisch und Gefährlich?", August 2013
